    <li style="color:white;"><b class="none" style="color:white;">A brief intro:</b> <br> My mother gave my name, “Srijanak” that means “Creator”. The root of scientific creativity lies
  in questioning the impossible. “Greatness is a journey that begins with the impossible and turnsinto the unforgettable”, was once said by Miguel Torres. I may borrow words from the iconicspeech on freedom and justice of a great American, Martin Luther King, to affirm with unsulliedconviction that  I have a  dream. I  have  a dream to turn an impossible into unforgettable  bygroundbreaking scientific invention that would change the world. As a liberal humanist with anabiding love for science, I have a dream to shepherd the prodigious advancement of science for
  the benefits of mankind and make this planet a better place to live in through my pioneering contribution in science and technology.
</li>
</p>
<br>
<p id="c2" style="color:white;">
<li style="color:white;"><b class="none" style="color:white;">Aspiring to be in ten years:</b> <br>In ten years, I want to see myself to be apart of a team of innovators in NASA engaged in the design and development of the robotic fleet to advance human exploration of space.
</li>
</p>
<br>
<p id="c3" style="color:white;">
<li style="color:white;"><b class="none" style="color:white;">Things I love doing:</b> <br>Whenever I get a chance, I try to imagine various situations in life and perform imaginary role-plays. For example, I do shadow practice of a soccer or cricket match, whereby I keep a check on my shadow as I practice various game techniques to improve my action and sharpness without actually playing. Similarly, I imagine myself playing a leadership role in a fictional event orpresenting my new scientific invention to a group of renowned scientists and then I show mimicry of the corresponding actions to my friends and peers. In addition to entertaining others, I derive fun from these role-plays as I can elevate myself to any level beyond limits. Besides, I love listening to songs especially Rabindrasangeet, practice singing them, watch football dribbling skills and movies on the net.

<br>
<p id="c4" style="color:white;">
<li style="color:white;"><b class="none" style="color:white;">Strong points:</b> <ol><li>I possess a natural talent in logical and rational thinking.</li><li>I am amiable,responsible,honest and loyal.</li><li>For me even the sky is not my limit. I strongly believe that dedication, determination and perseverance and true faith can move mountains and I try converting this belief of mine into practice.</li></ol>
</li>
<br>
<li style="color:white;"><b class="none" style="color:white;">Weak points:</b> <ol><li>I cannot easily forget events which tend to hurt me. But on a positive note, I often use this ability of mine in achieving feets on my second attempt, failure of which in the first one had hurt me.</li><li>I trust people very easily. Sometimes, it has some ill-effects, but at the same time it often helps me in doing team work in a much better way.</li><li>I am kind and caring and I possess a very soft heart and thus get emotional and sensitive to issues quite often.</li></ol>
